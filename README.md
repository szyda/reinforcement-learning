# Snake Game with AI and Deep Q-Learning
This project is an AI-driven Snake game built using Deep Q-Learning. The goal of the project is to train an agent (the AI player) to take actions (move in different directions) based on the current state of the game, using a neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function. The project is based on the Python programming language and leverages the Pygame library for building the game interface.

The Deep Q-Learning algorithm used in the project is a type of reinforcement learning that involves training an agent to take actions that maximize the expected cumulative reward over a sequence of actions. The project involves implementing a neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function and updating the network using the Q-Learning algorithm.

This project is a great way to explore the field of reinforcement learning and gain hands-on experience building an AI-driven game. It requires a good understanding of programming concepts and a willingness to experiment with different parameters to optimize the performance of the agent.
